# READ BEFORE USING

These files are meant for production deployments of the package. This diectory include the following files

```
- Dockerfile
- entrypoint.sh
```

The dockerfile is for docker containers, the entrypoint.sh works with the dockerfile.
The entrypoint generates self signed certs for the wss (websocket secure) feature, that is the default in the package.
It only runs if no certs are provided, but the script has to check that, so it should stay anyway.

Other than that, there isn't much else here. This is just to store the files needed for easy deployment.
